# React Noughts and Crosses - TypeScript

The React Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) tutorial game in TypeScript.

Using instructions on setting up React and Webpack with TypeScript [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html).

Original tutorial can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js & NPM

## Setup

Install TypeScript and Webpack globally.

```bash
npm install -g typescript webpack
```

Install npm dependencies (in the root of this repository).

```bash
npm install
```

Link TypeScript to this repo.

```bash
npm link typescript
```

If that doesn't work (eg if you're running in an environment that can't create symlinks), then install typescript for this repo.

```bash
npm install typescript
```

Build the app itself with webpack.

```bash
webpack
```
